    With funding and technical assistance from Center for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), ICAP in collaboration
    with Ministry of Health (MOH) Kenya is implementing an Integrated Health Facility-Based Surveillance (IFBS)
    project in 10 health facilities in Kenya. The overall objective of the surveillance project is to improve health
    security in
    Kenya by contributing to early detection, reporting and response to outbreaks of emerging and endemic priority
    infectious diseases and conditions. This dashboard shows surveillance data collected in these health facilities
    since project launch in 2017. Currently, the project is active in 10/13 health facilities.
