    <p>
      With funding and technical assistance from Center for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), ICAP in collaboration
      with the Ministry of Health (MOH) through the Division of Disease Surveillance and Response (DDSR) is implementing
      an Integrated Health Facility-Based Surveillance (IFBS) project in 10 health facilities in Kenya.
    </p>

    <p>
      Facility-based mortality surveillance is a key component of the Integrated Health Facility-Based Surveillance
      (IFBS) that allows for analyses of demographic, clinical, pathological and epidemiological characteristics of
      COVID-19 for people who died at the participating health facilities. Samples are collected from cadavers enrolled
      in the study through minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) procedures or through nasopharyngeal/oral swabs and
      tested for COVID-19.
    </p>

    <p>
      This data will rapidly increase the availability of timely and quality mortality data to aid in the computation of
      excess mortality which is useful for the determination of the public health impact of COVID-19 and other pathogens
      and syndromes of interest.

      This dashboard displays mortality surveillance data collected since project launch in April 2023. The dashboard
      has separate pages described as follows:
